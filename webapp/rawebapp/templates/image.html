     The image is completely unique and was generated using math only, through the following process:
    </p>
    <p class='expr_extra'>
        1: A tree of operators (shown above) is generated, by an algorithm that makes random choices of the
        operators to include, <br/>the number of branches and depth of the tree. This process, and the core operators,
        were developed by Andrej Bauer.
    </p>
    <p class='expr_extra'>

        2: The operators are evaluated, starting at the leaves, ending at the root (from right to left in above image),
        resulting in the final image
    </p>
    <p class='expr_extra'>
        Operators are can be simple; for example 'ReturnX' just returns the pixels x -coordinates as values
        for red, green and blue. More complex operators, for example 'Mix' or 'Sine', take the output of one or more
        other operators and operate on those.<br/> The 'Mandle' operator evaluates the Mandlebrot set,
        at a random location chosen from an inventory of interesting locations composed by David Eck. <br/>
        The Mandlebrot operator,  tree visualisation, numpy implementation and this webapp were added by Lindert Blonk
